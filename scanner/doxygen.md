API Overview {#mainpage}
=========

This is the auto-generated documentation for Scanner's C++ API. You should look here if you are implementing a C++ kernel and want to see, for example, what functions a kernel is expected to implement.

* Custom kernels: [scanner::BaseKernel](@ref scanner::BaseKernel) and [scanner::Kernel](@ref scanner::Kernel)
* Stream elements: [scanner::Element](@ref scanner::Element) and [scanner::Frame](@ref scanner::Frame)
* Custom sources: [scanner::Source](@ref scanner::Source) and [scanner::Enumerator](@ref scanner::Enumerator)
* Custom sources: [scanner::Sink](@ref scanner::Sink)
* Profiling: [scanner::Profiler](@ref scanner::Profiler)

System internals are not well documented, please read the source code or contact the authors if you have questions about that.
