Guide
=====

The guide is designed to get you quickly started using Scanner for your application, and then gradually expose you to more of the advanced concepts in Scanner. 

The guide is organized into the following sections:

- :ref:`quickstart`: run a simple Scanner program in as few steps as possible.
- :ref:`getting-started`: get Scanner set up on your machine and ready for writing your own applications.
- :ref:`walkthrough`: step-by-step walkthrough of a Scanner application.
- :ref:`graphs`: describes computation graphs, which are how applications are represented in Scanner.
- :ref:`ops`: describes the properties of ops (operations). Ops are the nodes in computation graphs that process data.
- :ref:`extensions`: learn how to extend Scanner with custom functionality.
- :ref:`kubernetes`: run Scanner in the cloud with Kubernetes.
