Kubernetes Integration
======================

The easiest way to scale out using Scanner is via `kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`__.
Kubernetes is tool for automating the deployment and management of a cluster of
machines that run `containers <https://www.docker.com/what-container#/package_software>`__
(a container is akin to a light-weight VM image).

We provide a step-by-step example of getting Scanner up and running on your own
kubernetes cluster using either `Google Cloud Platform <https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner/tree/master/examples/apps/gcp_kubernetes>`__
or `Amazon Web Services <https://github.com/scanner-research/scanner/tree/master/examples/apps/aws_kubernetes>`__.
