    # Ops can have several attributes that affect which stream elements they
    # will receive or how they will receive them. These attributes include:
    #
    # - Batch: The Op can receive multiple elements at once to enable SIMD
    #          or vector-style processing.
    #
    # - Stencil: The Op requires a window of input elements (for example, the
    #            previous and next element) at the same time to produce an
    #            output.
    #
    # - Bounded State: For each output, the Op requires at least W sequential
    #                  "warmup" elements before it can produce a valid output.
    #                  For example, if the output of this Op is sampled
    #                  sparsely, this guarantees that the Op can "warmup"
    #                  its state on a stream of W elements before producing the
    #                  requested output.
    #
    # - Unbounded State: This Op will always process all preceding elements of
    #                    its input streams before producing a requested output.
    #                    This means that sampling operations after this Op
    #                    can not change how many inputs it receives. In the next
    #                    tutorial, we will show how this can be relaxed for
    #                    sub-streams of the input.
    #
    # The rest of this tutorial will show examples of each attribute in action.

    # Batch
    # Here we specify that the histogram kernel should receive a batch of 8
    # input elements at once. Logically, each element is still processed
    # independently but multiple elements are provided for efficient
    # batch processing. If there are not enough elements left in a stream,
    # the Op may receive less than a batch worth of elements.
    histogram = db.ops.Histogram(frame=frame, batch=8)

    # Stencil
    diff = db.ops.FrameDifference(frame=frame, stencil=[-1, 0])
