    "To explore how Scanner fits in to a bigger pipeline, we're going to walk through a simple video analysis application. If you want to analyze a film, a common unit of analysis is the _shot_, short segments of video often delineated by the camera cutting to a different angle or location. In this walkthrough, we're going to use Scanner to implement _shot segmentation_, or breaking up a video into shots. To start, we need to get a video. We'll use a scene from Baby Driver:"

    "Take another look at the video and see if you can identify when shots change. Our shot segmentation algorithm uses the following intuition: in a video, most frames are similar to the one following it. Because most shot changes happen with cuts (as opposed to dissolves or fades), there's an immediate visual break from one frame to the next. We want to identify when the change in visual content between two adjacent frames is substantially larger than normal. One way to estimate change in visual content is by computing a histogram of colors for each frame, i.e. count the number of dark pixels and light pixels in each color channel (red/green/blue), and then compute the magnitude of difference between adjacent frames' histograms. Let's visualize this for the above video:"

To accelerate this analysis, we need to speed up the core computation, computing the color histogram. Here are some ways we can make that faster:\n",
